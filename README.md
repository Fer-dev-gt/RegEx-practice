# RegEx-practice
Here I'll practice Regular Expressions (RegEx) in order to dominate these amazing tools that help us to find and change pretty much any kind of data/string, this repo contains many RegEx sentences designed to find a specific format of required data like: national phone numbers, valid emails, URLs. This repo has 2 datasets in a .csv file and some miscellaneous data pieces in a .txt file.

Also this repo doesn't only focus on just finding a specific piece of data, it comes with expressions that change the presentation of data and gives them a new format to make matched date more readable and create useful information. I implemented all these RegEx sentences in many programming languages like: Python, PHP, Perl (old I know), Java and Javascript, this was done with the goal to see how we can implement these amazing tools in our everyday programming.

So my goal here is to learn how to RegEx in order to no longer make the joke "If you've got a problem and want to solve it with RegEx, then you've got 2 problems...". Let's get started an enjoy! ðŸ¤“ðŸ’»ðŸ”Ž

# I also used Python to process the data
